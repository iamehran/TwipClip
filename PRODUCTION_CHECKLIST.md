## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Production-ready: User-based YouTube auth, Railway optimizations"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **In Railway Dashboard**:
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Set environment variables
   - Deploy from master branch
   - Monitor build logs

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - Test health endpoint
   - Download and test helper executable
   - Verify YouTube authentication flow
   - Test video processing with authenticated user

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **YouTube Authentication**: Each user must authenticate with their own YouTube account using the helper app
2. **Storage**: Railway uses ephemeral storage - files in `/tmp` are temporary
3. **Scaling**: Monitor memory usage, Railway free tier has limits
4. **Updates**: Regularly update yt-dlp by rebuilding the Docker image

## üîç Monitoring

- Check Railway logs for errors
- Monitor API usage (OpenAI costs)
- Track authentication success rate
- Watch for timeout errors on long videos

## üÜò Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Railway automatically keeps previous deployments
2. Can rollback with one click in Railway dashboard
3. Keep note of last known good deployment SHA
