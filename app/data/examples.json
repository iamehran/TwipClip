    "thread": "Sam Altman just revealed OpenAI's master plan and it's not what anyone expected\n---\nIn his latest interview, he admitted GPT-4 was \"embarrassingly bad\" compared to what's coming. But here's the kicker - they're not just building better AI\n---\nThey're building AGI that can do scientific research. Altman says we're 2-3 years away from AI that can cure diseases on its own\n---\nThe craziest part? OpenAI is already testing GPT-5 internally. And according to insiders, it makes GPT-4 look like a toy",

    "thread": "Nvidia was almost bankrupt in 1997. Today they're worth $3 trillion. The story of how Jensen Huang pulled this off is insane\n---\nIn 1997, Nvidia had 3 months of cash left. Their graphics chips were failing. Jensen made a desperate pivot to something called 'GPU computing'\n---\nEveryone thought he was crazy. \"Why would anyone need parallel processing?\" they said. Then AI happened. And Nvidia had the only chips that could handle it\n---\nToday, every AI company on Earth needs Nvidia chips. They control 80% of the AI chip market. Jensen Huang saw the future 25 years early",

    "thread": "SpaceX just did something everyone said was impossible - caught a 230-foot rocket booster with mechanical arms. Here's why this changes everything\n---\nThe Starship booster weighs 300 tons and was falling at 500mph. SpaceX caught it like a baseball. This isn't just cool - it's revolutionary\n---\nWhy? Because it makes Mars colonization actually affordable. Catching and reusing boosters cuts launch costs by 99%. We can now send 150 tons to Mars for $2 million\n---\nElon's timeline: First cargo missions to Mars in 2026. First humans in 2028. It sounds crazy until you realize SpaceX has hit every major milestone so far",

    "thread": "Google's DeepMind just solved a 50-year-old problem in biology. Their AI can now predict how proteins fold with 90% accuracy. Here's why this is huge\n---\nProteins are the machines that run your body. But we couldn't predict their shapes from DNA. It's like having blueprints but not knowing what the building looks like\n---\nAlphaFold changed that overnight. It solved 200 million protein structures in 18 months. Scientists used to spend years solving just one\n---\nNow we can design new medicines in days instead of decades. Cancer drugs, antibiotics, even plastic-eating enzymes. This is the biggest breakthrough in biology since DNA",

They're building digital workers that can use computers like humans. Book flights, write code, do research - all autonomously\n---\nSatya Nadella let it slip: \"In 5 years, every person will have an AI agent doing 80% of their work.\" That's 1.5 billion jobs being transformed\n---\nThe wildest part? These agents can work 24/7, never make mistakes, and cost $20/month. We're about to see the biggest labor shift in human history",
