# Why Google Video Intelligence Can't Process YouTube URLs

## The Technical Reality

Google Video Intelligence API requires **direct access to video file data**. It needs:
- Direct `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov` file URLs
- Publicly accessible without authentication
- Raw video stream access

YouTube provides:
- Encrypted, chunked video streams
- DRM-protected content
- Dynamic URLs that expire
- No direct file access

## Would Download + Upload Work?

Technically yes, but it requires:

1. **Download YouTube video** (✅ Possible with yt-dlp)
2. **Upload to Cloud Storage** (❌ Requires setup):
   - Google Cloud Storage bucket
   - Public access permissions
   - Temporary URL generation
   - Cleanup after processing

3. **Process with Video Intelligence** (✅ Would work)

## Why Whisper is Better for YouTube

1. **Simpler**: Download audio → Transcribe → Done
2. **Faster**: No need to download full video (just audio)
3. **Cheaper**: Whisper ($0.006/min) vs Video Intelligence ($0.048/min)
4. **No extra setup**: Works immediately with just API key

## Current Implementation

The system intelligently:
1. Tries YouTube captions first (free, fastest)
2. Falls back to Whisper for videos without captions
3. Only uses Google Video Intelligence for direct MP4 URLs

This is the most practical approach for production use.
